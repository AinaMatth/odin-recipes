    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced onion</li>
        <li>8 cups chopped romaine lettuce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup pecans, toasted and chopped</li>
        <li>1/3 cup raisins</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Brush cut sides of butternut squash with olive oil. <br>Wrap each squash half tightly in aluminum foil. </li>
        <li>Roast squash halves in the preheated oven until they begin to soften, about 20 minutes. <br>Remove squash from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle. <br>Remove foil and slice into 3/4-inch thick slices. <br>Remove skin from each slice and cut into 3/4-inch cubes. <br>Set aside 8 cups of the cubed squash, reserving any remaining squash for another use. </li>
        <li> Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. <br>Remove bacon and drain on paper towels. <br>Add onions to the skillet and cook in the bacon grease for 2 to 3 minutes. <br>Add 8 cups squash and cook, tossing occasionally, until onions are soft and beginning to caramelize, and squash cubes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Place romaine lettuce in a large serving bowl; crumble bacon on top and add pecans and raisins. <br>Add butternut squash-onion mixture; toss to combine. <br>Drizzle with maple syrup and serve warm.
